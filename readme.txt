Shinyguitar is a sample library for Plogue Sforzando version 1.822 or newer. It contains samples of an archtop guitar played and mapped by D. Smolken.

This instrument is open source, and you can do whatever you want with it; however, the XML bank contains a digital signature, and editing the XML bank will break the ability of Plogue Sforzando to load the instrument with the GUI.

To register, drag the Shinyguitar.bank.xml file onto the Sforzando interface. Once registered, Shinyguitar will be available in the Sforzando loading menu.
